                                <h2>Technical Writer</h2>
                                <p>I discovered my passion for technical writing during my undergraduate studies in journalism. It combined my passion for crafting narratives with my interest in technology. During my sophomore year, I decided to pivot my academic focus towards technical writing with an emphasis in Information Technology (IT).</p>
                                <p>What captivates me about technical writing is its ability to combine rhetoric, characterized by purposeful articulation, with the creative freedom of design. These two disciplines perpetually fascinate me. They give me an opportunity to continually challenge myself in crafting content that integrates readability with aesthetics.</p>
                                <p>In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in music and playing the electric guitar in my band. I also like to travel around the US to connect with family and friends. When I’m not off on adventures, you’ll find me at home, cooking delicious meals and playing video games.</p>
                                <p>My overarching goal is to serve as a catalyst for innovation and progress. I’d like to utilize my expertise in technical writing and design to effect meaningful change. Each project serves as a way to enhance user experiences, optimize organizational structures, and learn more about this constantly advancing field. I’m grateful that I get to be a part of something that can have a positive impact on users.</p>
